## Hello there my friend :sparkles: 

Hello there! I'm Ximena and I study Computer Sciences at Universidad de Sonora, Hermosillo, MX, currently on my 7th semester.
My main interests are Software Engineering, Machine Learning and UX-UI.

Outside computer science related activities I enjoy illustrasting, being salty in videogames and watching ghibli movies.
