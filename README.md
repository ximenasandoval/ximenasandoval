## Hello there my friend :sparkles: 

Hello there! I'm Ximena and I am a Computer Sciences graduate from Universidad de Sonora, Hermosillo, MX. My main interests are Software Engineering, DevOps, and lately, UX-UI.

Outside computer science-related stuff I enjoy illustrating and watching Studio Ghibli movies.
